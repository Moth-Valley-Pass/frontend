  "description": "Yoni Alter is a multimedia artist exploring the threshold between art and design. His vibrantly coloured works segue between the figurative, the abstract, form, and space, always challenging viewers to look twice. Guided by experimentation and semiotics, Yoni passionately seeks new ways of creating visual representations, working across sculpture, painting, print, and digital media.",
